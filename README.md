RAG Chatbot POC for Prod Support:

Please use Python 3.10(.2) to be safe for llamaindex and python version compatibilities.

Steps to run with and without virtual environment are in respectively named txt files. - steps with venv.txt and stpes without venv.txt

backend_updatable_start.py and frontend_updatable_start.py are final ones,
backeng_rag_chatbot.py and frontend_rag_chatbot.py are for PoC.

Separate .env should be created too in same folder as python files with OPENAI_API_KEY variable = value, so that it can be used.
