Steps to run Production Support RAG Chatbot

Use files:
backend_updatable_start.py
frontend_updatable_start.py
.env
requirements.txt
index (optional)
in a folder

open cmd (command prompt)
Run: cd C:\Personal\Internship\Sumeru\RAG\Demo\final # Navigate to a folder where the files are
in case it isn't in the folder of the files

Run without virtual environment then just run:
	pip install fastapi uvicorn streamlit requests python-dotenv llama-index openai
	let it run and finish


Then
 open another terminal in same location/duplicate terminal 

update backend_updatable_start.py:
l1_directory_path = "C:\\Personal\\Internship\\Sumeru\\RAG\\Demo\\NewData\\Data\\L1"
l2_directory_path = "C:\\Personal\\Internship\\Sumeru\\RAG\\Demo\\NewData\\Data\\L2"

with path to L1 and L2 folders respectively and then run these in a terminal each:

uvicorn backend_updatable_start:app --reload

Let this say Application Startup Complete, then in another terminal run - 

streamlit run frontend_updatable_start.py

2nd one should open the app
